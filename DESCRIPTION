Description: Provides a 'ggplot2' centric approach to bivariate mapping. This is a 
    technique that maps two quantities simultaneously rather than the single value 
    that most thematic maps display. The package provides a suite of tools 
    for calculating breaks using multiple different approaches, a selection of 
    palettes appropriate for bivariate mapping and scale functions for 'ggplot2' 
    calls that adds those palettes to maps. Tools for creating bivariate legends 
    are also included.
